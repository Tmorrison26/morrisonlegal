                    Life can be so challenging, and sometimes we can seem to lose our way – getting lost in the spinning, the confusion, the uncertainty. 
                    Emotions can feel like they spiral or swing so rapidly that it can feel difficult to find stable ground, let alone direction for our lives. 
                    Maybe you have experienced this – that shift between anxiety & depression & irritability – that sense of feeling lost or struggling to see a way forward in your life.   
                    <br/>Maybe you have felt lost as you wander on a path that doesn’t seem to go anywhere… Or maybe you’re standing at a fork in the road and you aren’t sure which way to go
                    <br/>It is a known fact that a compass points to magnetic north.
                    If you were wandering around in the wilderness, what would be one of the most important instruments you could have with you to help you stay oriented? 
                    A simple compass is amazing because when you pick it up, it always points to magnetic north.
                    However, this is not the same as true north, or the geographic (or geodetic) north pole. 
                    The difference between magnetic north and true north is currently a matter of several hundred miles—but it changes, due to the fact that the magnetic north pole drifts several miles a year.

                    The earth produces a magnetic field. The places where the lines of magnetic induction converge are called the magnetic poles. The location of the magnetic north pole changes over time. In contrast, true north is a fixed spot on the globe: the true north pole is found at the conjunction of the lines of longitude, the point at which the earth’s axis exits the globe. Magnetic north varies position from year to year; true north is unchanging.  
                    <br/>
                    As humans, we have a genuine desire to know "who I am". Yet, unfortunately, we often seek to define ourselves through people or pursuits that too often leave us more disoriented... confused... stuck. 
                    <br/>
                    We have confidence that the world is providing the best direction, advice, or moral standard of how we ought to live, raise our children, and treat each other. We observe magnetic or worldly north and are persuaded to believe it is true north. The crux of the problem is that if we follow the worldly north, it takes us further and further from heavenly or true north. 
                    <br/>
                    Researchers agree that struggles such as depression and anxiety can create a downward cycle, and effectively pull us further from our path – our true north.  At Compass Reset Counseling, we want to help you better navigate your path and be able to break that downward spiral – to truly ‘reset’ your life in a direction you wish to be going.
                    You can find your path.

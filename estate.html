                        Estate Planning is the process of having various documents drafted and signed by an individual to provide guidance on how the person’s 
                        affairs should be handled upon the person’s death or if the person becomes incapacitated and unable to handle the person’s own affairs. 
                        A basic Estate Plan will include a Power of Attorney, Advanced Directive for Health Care, and a Last Will and Testament.
